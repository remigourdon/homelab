# Homelab

My homelab in its current iteration is built around a Kubernetes cluster, codename `clarke` after English cryptanalist [Joan Clarke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_Clarke), who worked alongside [Alan Turing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing) on the Enigma project during WWII.

Some of the nodes of this cluster run on a [Turing Pi](https://turingpi.com/), which ties the names of these two historical figures in the fabric of my lab.
